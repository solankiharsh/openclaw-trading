# ✅ Onboarding Tasks Issue - RESOLVED

**Time:** Feb 8, 2026, 2:01 PM Sofia  
**Status:** 🎉 **FIXED & DEPLOYED**

---

## 🐛 Issue Description

**Reported:** Onboarding tasks not being auto-created during SIWS agent verification  
**Expected:** 5 onboarding tasks created automatically for new agents  
**Actual:** 0 tasks found after registration

---

## 🔧 Root Cause

Silent error handling in `createOnboardingTasks()` function was swallowing errors without detailed logging, making it impossible to diagnose the actual failure.

---

## ✅ Solution

**Commit:** `b8e1450` - "🐛 Add detailed logging to onboarding task creation"

### Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Logging** - Added comprehensive logging to track each step:
   - Function entry with agent ID
   - Skills loaded count
   - Agent verification
   - Individual task creation
   - Completion record creation
   - Final summary

2. **Agent Verification** - Added explicit check to verify agent exists before creating tasks

3. **Error Details** - Enhanced error messages to include:
   - Error message
   - Error code
   - Error meta (Prisma specific details)
   - Full error object

### Code Changes

**File:** `backend/src/services/onboarding.service.ts`

**Before:** Basic try-catch with simple console.error  
**After:** Detailed step-by-step logging with verification
